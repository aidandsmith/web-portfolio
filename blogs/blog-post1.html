                    I have always been super passionate about everything on the web. I first started my education in SAIT's (Southern Alberta Institute of Technology) cyber security program, but after a year, I realized that it may not be the path for me.
                </p>

                <h2>Facts about me</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am 22 years old.</li>
                    <li>I love video games, my current game is - Marvel Rivals</li>
                    <li>I love the outdoors - fly fishing, and camping</li>
                    <li>My favourite food is sushi</li>
                    <li>I am a huge Calgary Flames fan</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What caused the switch-up?</h2>
                <p>
                    When first deciding what I wanted to do with my life, I knew it had to be something in the tech space -- I had always heard about the need for cyber security specialists, so I decided to give it a shot. One thing that bugged me about that profession is the fact you couldn't see your progress, it was alot of numbers and terminal work that just didnt satisfy my need to see progress. Thats when I found Interactive Design - Web Development program and it sparked my interest.
                </p>

                <h2>What have I been working on?</h2>
                <p>
                   Over the past 2 years I have been focusing primarily on HTML, CSS, and JS. These 3 languages are very powerful and a good start for anyone who wants to get into the industry of web development. This semester we have also been working on the back-end language PHP - learning database integration, CMS, and encryption/decryption etc.
                </p>

                <h2>Where I want to see myself in 2 years...</h2>
                <p>
                   In 2 years from now I want to be in a spot where I am comfortable with all the modern languages, frameworks, and libraries that are used in UI and web development. Currently I have started the process of learning React.JS and Node.JS for back-end development. I have realized there are so many technologies out there, and there will definitely be new ones coming out in the next couple years, but I want to try and stay relevant with these, but focus on one thing at a time.
                </p>

                <h2>Quote of the day</h2>
                <p>Every blog I have decided to add a quote that means something to me and possibly inspire you, the reader.</p>
