                    HTML, CSS & JavaScript are the stepping stones of web development, and I knew it was something I should learn when starting my web development career. When I first started learning one of the struggles I had was learning how each of them work together and separate from each other. This blog post will give you insight on what it's like to learn these languages for the first time.

                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML which is short for HyperText Markup Language is seen everywhere on the modern web in some way. It is a simple language that structures, like a house: the walls, foundation, roof. All the content on the web is then passed to google when you upload your code and allows it to figure out your website's structure to optimize it for the web. HTML works with tags that enclose content between them, for example: &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
                </p>
 
 
                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                <p>
                   CSS which is short for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style and design your HTML markup. Think of this as the design of the house: paint, furniture, and decor. CSS is applied to your different HTML tags, and is used to make a website look good. Without CSS most sites would be very basic, and just look like a bunch of scrambled text on a webpage. There is so many things you can do with CSS, a couple examples are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Change Colors üé®</li>
                    <li>Adjust fonts and font sizes üî†</li>
                    <li>Create layouts, and control spacing üìè</li>
                    <li>Add responsiveness - mobile, tablet üì±</li>
                    <li>Add cool animations ‚ú®</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
 
 
                <h2>What is JS?</h2>
                <p>
                   JavaScript is a programming language that runs on the web, and it is responsible for making websites interactive. Think of JavaScript as the electricity of the house, powering all your appliances - it makes this work or respond when you click, interact or type with elements on a website. JavaScript is one of the most common languages used today on the web as it helps with interactivity, creating animations, validating user forms, and loading dynamic content (real-time updates or notifications on a website.)
                </p>
 
 
                <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with the basics - learn HTML -> CSS -> JS.</li>
                    <li>Tons of practice - best way to learn is by doing projects! Just build something.</li>
                    <li>Learn to think like a programmer - break down a problem into achievable steps.</li>
                    <li>Join a community of developers - Discord, Slack etc.</li>
                    <li>Ask questions! - if you don't know ask - don't rely on ChatGPT, use online forums like StackOverflow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Quote of the day</h2>
                <p>Todays quote of the day:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    ‚ÄúFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.‚Äù - Aristotle
